A simple script for the Kaggle-MNIST challenge.

Achieved a 0.99286 on its first submission, after one hour of training with no hyperparameter optimization and minimal dataset enhancement. 

The network architecture is based on an Inception net, and implemented in Keras.  It also demonstrates Keras' support for generators for high-performance dataset enhancement.
